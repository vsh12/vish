## Stepping SIMS, Lonavla
After a long-towering vacation, time has come for me and our clan to fix the base for life. We've been roving for months and finally its time for our Higher Graduation, stood as a great barrier for us. Being set forth by kingfisher our band was partioned by colleges, cities even states but were still united by the king of good times. Though scoring a de-cent grade in board exams i was likely to jump out of the state for my graduation. On 28th July 2014, left my home and was a great send of from my buddies. At the Railway Station after boarding i was a bit enthusiastic yet not worried as my parents were with me, yes obviously missing my bro's and my SweetHeart. That was a fine journey of 36 hours, enjoying the ride with a splendid climate. After entering Maharashtra, train started to bundle up people and we were about to disembark at LONAVLA at 30th early morning around 0400 Hrs. Once stepped out of Railway Station started a monsterous rain that made us mad that moment as we were unfamiliar and especially from Tamil Nadu. There we managed to fetch and auto and finally checked in at an hotel. After a power nap for 4 hrs, straight away boarded the college bus from the provided location. After reaching college and finally enrolling, had our breakfast at 1100 hrs. Few hours passed and we were alloted a cabin for us with a guideline that each room accomodates 3 cadets and each from different state of origin. The day ended by tears in my Mom's eyes as she left me for the first time.

On 21st september 2014 we decided do move out of city to visit pune. That was my first visit to Pune, once the train stopped at the station we were eager to drift around the city and as our seniors adviced we decided to explore Phoenix Market City wich was a 20 minutes travel from the station.

>Phoenix Market City is a shopping mall developed by Phoenix Mills Limited located in Pune, Maharashtra. It was opened in January 2013 and is the largest mall in India, with the area of 3.4 million square feet.

The day was unforgetable as we visited Blu-O, a pub for the first time and surprisingy we had a free entry.Though the day was splendid,we departed reluctantly all the way to SIMS as we are not allowed inside the campus after 1830 Hrs.
